  <h1>Introduction to the NHS login service</h1>
  <p>  The NHS login Service (the service) is a new capability delivered by NHS Digital which comprises the processes and supporting technology for people to prove who they are online. 

The benefits of the service are:

•	the citizen only must go through a rigorous identity verification process once, after which they can access a range of health and care websites and apps securely using a single set of login credentials; and 
•	services that use NHS login (Reliant Party Services – RPS) are relived of the burden of verifying a user’s identity.  

The goal of the service is to facilitate the availability of health services to citizens online as securely and seamlessly as possible. NHS login provides a foundational capability which is required for the successful expansion of digital health services, supporting an anticipated reduction in the burden on frontline services delivered by a channel shift to online provision of them.
  
NHS login comprises processes for identifying and verifying a user’s identity, and the supporting technology (NHS login System) to support both the verification stage and ongoing user account and logon services to be consumed by Reliant Party Services (RPS).  

The NHS login System is internet facing using Open ID Connect and the Oauth2.0 protocols alongside FIDO (Fast Identity Online) specifications for improving the user’s experience of accessing services. 

The service was released into Private Beta in September 2018, supporting the NHS App which is also in private beta – NHS App is the login service’s first RPS. Both NHS login and NHS App are due to enter Public Beta in March 2019. 
The NHS login service is capable of verifying a user’s’ identity and setting a clearly defined level of verification for their account at a level ranging from no verification to fully verified, where “fully verified” means verified with a level of confidence that satisfies NHS login, and therefore RPS’s relying on NHS login for access management , that the user can be granted access to sensitive information such as medical records.

The remainder of this document explains the key components of the service, focusing on the technology underpinning the service, the NHS login System. Readers are also referred to the detailed External Interface Specification (EIS) for the service which is available here -> https://developer.nhs.uk/library/systems/nhs-login-info-suppliers/eis/ .
