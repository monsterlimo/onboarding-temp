      <h2>What is NHS login?</h2>
      <p>NHS login is a quick and secure way for users to prove their identity online, allowing them to access digital health and social care services as seamlessly as possible. This will help reduce the burden on frontline services and reduce costs for the NHS.</p>
      <p>NHS login is a <strong>free service</strong>. It makes sure you’re giving the right people access without the effort and cost of developing and managing your own identity platform. </p>
      <p>NHS login offers different levels of verification so you can choose the most appropriate for your service. User records can be created with no verification for generic NHS services and information, whereas full verification allows access to sensitive information such as medical records.</p>
      <p>NHS login can co-exist with your own login system. It also has the facility to generate GP system linkage keys, subject to commercial agreement.</p>
      <p>The service was released into Private Beta in September 2018. NHS App is the login service’s first partner.</p>

      <h2>Is it right for your service?</h2>
      <p>NHS login is designed and funded for Health and Social Care services.</p>

      <p>If your service aligns to NHS strategy and delivers benefits to the NHS and social care ecosystem you can use NHS login to check a user’s identity.</p>

      <p>Your service might need to do this if it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>shows a user personal information about themselves, such as their medical records</li>
        <li>replaces a form that needs to be physically signed by a user</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The team behind NHS login work in a user-centred, agile way. As such, the service will be continually improved via iterative releases that have been validated via user research and testing.</p>
