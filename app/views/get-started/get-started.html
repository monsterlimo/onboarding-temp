    <p>NHS login is currently in a private beta, during which we will be testing the onboarding process with a small number of partners to understand the timescales involved and to refine and improve the process.</p>
    <p>NHS login is due for public beta in March 2019.</p>

    <h2>Onboarding to NHS login</h2>
    <mark>add warning style</mark>
    <p>⚠️ Due to the number of partners waiting to use NHS login we are having to prioritise requests to join the public beta. Prioritisation will be based on a variety of factors such as strategic fit and benefits to health and social care.</p>
    <p>There are various steps to onboarding the service which include you providing usage forecasts, passing assurance standards, and determining the appropriate level of verification for your service.</p>

    <h2>Exploring technical integration</h2>
    <p>Technical teams can find step-by-step information on setting up the connection to NHS login on our GitHub repository.</p>

    <p>From the GitHub they can request access to the Sandpit which is a copy of our production code environment which will help you learn how to integrate with our service <mark> and mention stub?</mark></p>

    <p>We also have a Slack channel where our NHS login developers are on hand to answer technical questions and support partner organisations.</p>
    <mark>Add links to github / EIS / NHS login slack</mark>
    <mark>add the panel/promo styling for these</mark>
    <mark>add styling to highlight</mark>
    <p>Note: development in the Sandpit environment is a mandatory step to progressing through the onboarding process.</p>
