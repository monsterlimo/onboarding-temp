    <h4>NHS login is currently in a private beta, during which we will be testing the onboarding process with a small number of partners to understand the timescales involved and to refine and improve the process.</h4>
    <p>NHS login is due for public beta in March 2019.</p>

    <h2>Onboarding to NHS login</h2>
    {{ warningCallout({
        "heading": "Partner prioritisation",
        "HTML": "<p>Due to the number of partners waiting to use NHS login we are having to prioritise requests to join the public beta. Prioritisation will be based on a variety of factors such as strategic fit and benefits to health and social care.</p>"
      }) }}
    <p>There are various steps to onboarding the service which include you providing usage forecasts, passing assurance standards, and determining the appropriate level of verification for your service.</p>

    <h2>Exploring technical integration</h2>
    <p>Technical teams can find step-by-step information on setting up the connection to NHS login on our <a href="">GitHub repository</a><mark>add link</mark>.</p>

    <p>From the GitHub they can request access to the Sandpit which is a copy of our production code environment which will help you learn how to integrate with our service.</p>

    <p>We also have a <a href="https://stub.signin.nhs.uk/client" target="blank">"stub" environment</a> which is a lightweight representation of our OpenID Connect implementation. It’s a good way to get started with the technologies you will need to use when integrating with NHS login, such as OpenID Connect and the NHS login External Interface Specification.</p>
    
    <p>We also have a <a href="" target="blank">Slack channel</a> <mark>add link</mark> where our NHS login developers are on hand to answer technical questions and support partner organisations.</p>
