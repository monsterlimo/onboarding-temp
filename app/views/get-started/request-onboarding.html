    <h2>Request onboarding</h2>
    <h3>1. Request to be prioritised for onboarding</h3>
    <p>To begin the process you must first send an onboarding request email to <a href="">engage.nhslogin@nhs.net</a></p>

    <h3>2. Complete and return the ‘scoring spreadsheet’</h3>
    <p>The <a href="">scoring spreadsheet</a> allows us to prioritise your service against others wanting to join the beta. Prioritisation will be based on a variety of factors such as strategic fit and benefits to health and social care.</p>

    <h3>3. Provide usage forecasts</h3>
    <p>Once your service has been prioritised, we will ask you to provide <a href="">usage forecasts</a> so we ensure we can meet those demands during beta.</p>

    <h3>4. Complete Assurance Questions and Conformance Testing</h3>
    <mark>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Proin id lacus sit amet odio maximus elementum malesuada sed sem. Vestibulum vel tristique nisi.</mark>
    <p>Also tie-in testing within the Assurance environment</p>

    <h3>5. Set up Support with NHS login</h3>
    <p>NHS login is supported by the National Service Desk. You’ll need to be registered with the service desk in order to raise support tickets to us. <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/about-nhs-digital/our-work/keeping-patient-data-safe/gdpr/gdpr-register/national-service-desk" target="blank">Find out more here</a>.</p>

    <h3>6. Sign the connection agreement</h3>
    <p>Subject to passing the assurance standard, and successfully developing within the assurance environment, we will ask you to <a href="">sign a connection agreement</a> with NHS Digital. We’ll also require each of your end user organisations to sign a declaration.</p>


    <p>Once these steps are complete you can go live.</p>
