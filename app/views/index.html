      <h2>Why use NHS login?</h2>
      <p>If you’re building a health or social care app or website for patients, NHS login is a free, flexible solution which can take away the headache of creating an account for a user, verifying the users’ identity and linking it to an NHS number.</p>

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>NHS login is an internet facing system for identifying and verifying a user’s identity, which uses the <a href="https://openid.net/developers/specs/">Open ID Connect</a> and the <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">Oauth2.0 protocols</a>.</p>

      <p>It also uses <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">FIDO (Fast Identity Online) specifications</a> which improve the user experience by allowing Fingerprint ID and Face ID to seamlessly access native apps.</p>

      <h2>Get started</h2>
      <p>NHS login is currently in a private beta.</p>
      <p>Due to the number of partners waiting to use NHS login we are having to prioritise requests to join the public beta. Prioritisation will be based on a variety of factors such as strategic fit and benefits to health and social care.</p>
      <mark>left</mark>
      <p>There are various steps to onboarding the service which include you providing usage forecasts, passing assurance standards, and determining the appropriate level of verification for your service.</p>
