NHS login is a quick and very secure way for users to prove their identity online. It’s a safe way to make sure you’re giving the right people access to the confidential health information that your service provides without having to build or maintain your own digital identity check. 
NHS login is already being successfully used within the NHS App and is currently being offered to a wider audience of health services.
This information is a guide to the process to set you up with the NHS login platform, including the technical steps for connecting the NHS login to your website or app.
Do we need to say that NHS login is still in beta – or will it be fully live by the time this info is published?

<h2>Is the NHS login right for your service?</h2>
<p>Online services such as health websites and apps are at risk of identity fraud and sensitive and confidential medical information falling into the wrong hands. Using NHS login to prove your users’ identity online can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>help protect your website or app from identity fraud</li>
  <li>replace face-to-face identity checks</li>
  <li>reduce the need for users to send documents in the post</li>
</ul>

<h2>How NHS login works</h2>
<p>When logging into your website or app for the first time, users will be asked to set up an NHS login (username and password) using their email address and mobile phone. Users then have to go through a one-off step to prove their identity. To do this they:</p>
<ul>
  <li>upload a copy of a photo ID document, such as a passport or driving license</li>
  <li>upload a short video of themselves reading 4 randomly generated numbers out loud</li>
</ul>
<p>After the user has proved their identity, your service will be sent their NHS number, surname, and date of birth. You can also request other items, such as email address, which the user must consent to sharing with your service.</br>
The user can use the account they created with NHS login to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>sign back in to your service at any time</li>
  <li>access other health and care websites and apps that use NHS login</li>
</ul>
<p>If the user has already set up an NHS login, for example to use the NHS App, they can reuse the same username and password.
