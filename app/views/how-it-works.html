      <p>NHS login is an internet facing system for identifying and verifying a user’s identity.</p>
      <p>It uses the <a target="blank" href="https://openid.net/developers/specs/">Open ID Connect</a> and the <a target="blank" href="https://oauth.net/2/">Oauth2.0 protocols</a>. It also uses <a target="blank" href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/">FIDO (Fast Identity Online) specifications</a>  which improves the user’s experience by allowing Fingerprint ID and Face ID seamlessly access native apps.</p>
      <p>NHS login offers different levels of verification so you can choose the most appropriate for your service. To determine the right level of verification, <a href="how-it-works/authentication-verification">review the guidance within the standards</a> to understand the policy for the transactions within your service.</p>

        <li><strong>User signs up to a service</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Creates an NHS log in</strong><br />If the user does not already have an NHS login account they will be asked to:

          <ul>
            <li>set up their account by entering their email address and password.</li>
            <li>provide a mobile phone number to which they are sent a 4-digit code which they must enter as part of the 2FA process.</li>
            <li>accept the NHS login Service Terms and Conditions of use</li>
          </ul>
      
        <br />At this point, the user will have a basic NHS login account which will allow them access to generic NHS services and information which do not contain personalised and potentially sensitive data.
        <br />If the user requires access to services that make use of personal information, then they must verify their identity to the level required by the partner service.

        <br />To verify their identity, a user can either:
          <ul>
            <li>Use NHS login services to prove their identity online (referred to as Prove Your Identity (PYI)); or</li>
            <li>Use NHS login services and opt to re-use their existing GP Patient OnLine linkage key information (POL) to prove who they are.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        <li><strong>Takes a picture of their photo ID document</strong>

        <li><strong>ID verification</strong>
        <br />Once this information is submitted by the user, our Home Office trained ID Checkers, will verify the user’s identity. This is done by:
          <ul>
            <li>checking the ID submitted is valid</li>
            <li>checking the user is the same person on that ID using the video they submit of themselves</li>
            <li>running a search to find a match on the NHS Personal Demographics Service (PDS)</li>
            <li>attaching their NHS Number to their NHS login account.</li>

      <h2>Here’s how a user logs in using NHS login:</h2>
      <p>Once their NHS login account has been created, the next time the user navigates to a partner service’s login page, they will again be offered the option of signing into the system using NHS login.</p>
      <p>The user can enter their ID and Password plus 2FA code. You can also implement fingerprint or Face ID if your service is an app.</p>
      <p>The system then ensures the user has the appropriate level of verification for the service and logs them in.</p>
